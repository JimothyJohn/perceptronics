"""Parts by their volume: what stands the part's height above the work surface, the part's size.

The pick node's detector (2026-09-28, Nick: "look for a specific volume with expected
dimensions and align to the axes of the bounding box"). Colour plays no part: a part is
whatever stands off the surface, and it is *the* part when its top face measures the
part's length × width and stands its height above the surface — each within the
:class:`~perceptronics.partspec.PartSpec`'s tolerance. The foam blocks' white-threshold
misses in evening light (TODO 2026-09-27) cannot happen here.

One frame in, one :class:`Scene` out:

1. **Sample** the aligned depth on a grid (``stride`` px, chosen so a cell is ~3 mm on
   the surface) and place every sample in the base frame through the camera pose.
2. **The surface.** A taught plane (the Installation screen's pick location: three
   points touched with the fingertips) when there is one — its height nudged to the
   live frame by at most :data:`LIVE_NUDGE_M`, so a table that moved a few mm still
   works and one that moved more is reported. Without one, the surface is *fitted
   live*: level in the base frame (the table is flat and parallel to base XY — Nick,
   2026-09-27), at the most populated height; with no base frame (a camera-only
   preview) a RANSAC plane.
3. **Occupied cells** stand more than :func:`occupied_min_m` off the surface (and
   inside the taught area). Depth holes surrounded by occupied cells are filled; a
   real gap between two parts is not (it has the table's depth).
4. **Each 8-connected blob** is one candidate: its top face is the cells within
   :data:`TOP_BAND_M` of its (robust) highest height, and the top face's
   **minimum-area rectangle** in the surface's plane gives the centre, the axes and
   the length × width. The fingers close across the short side, so the grasp is
   parallel to the rectangle's short axis.
5. **Why not** — every candidate that isn't picked carries a reason the pendant shows:
   the wrong size (:meth:`PartSpec.why_not`), cut off by the picture's edge, outside the
   taught area, too close to the base or out of reach (:class:`Reach`), no room for the
   open fingers beside it (:func:`perceptronics.pickplan.clearance`).
6. **Pick order** — :func:`order_parts` numbers the pickable parts left→right /
   front→back (either way, rows either way) *as the picture shows them*, so the numbers
   the pendant draws are the order the program picks in.

Pure stdlib, O(cells): a Raspberry-Pi-class PC does a 848×480 frame in well under a
second at the default ~3 mm cells.
