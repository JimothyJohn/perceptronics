# PI.md — bringing up the Raspberry Pi 5 test board

The Pi 5 arrives **Thursday 2026-10-01**. It is the **test board** for the pick PC
(`deploy/pi/`); the kit board stays the Pi 4 in `hardware/BOM.md`, with an industrial Pi 4
a possibility later. Part 1 is for Nick (hands on the board, ~15 min). Part 2 is for the
Claude session (Fable) that does the rest over SSH from the Mac Studio.

Taking the board to the UR3e afterwards: **`PLUG-AND-PLAY.md`**. The reference for what the installer does is `deploy/pi/README.md`; the procedure is the
`deploy-pick-pc` skill. **Nothing in `deploy/pi/` has run on a board yet** (written
2026-09-28, CI-checked only) — Thursday is the first run, so the job is as much to record
what happens as to get it working.

Keeping it simple (Nick, 2026-09-30): a typical Raspberry Pi OS install, the existing
deploy script, a static address set by hand. No custom image, no setup hotspot — those are
under *Later*.

| | Thursday (bench) | On the cell |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ethernet | office LAN `10.0.0.0/24`, DHCP: internet for the build, SSH from the Mac Studio (`10.0.0.16`) | cell switch, static `192.168.3.20/24`, offline |
| Wi-Fi | not configured | not configured |
| D435 | blue USB 3 port | same |
| UR3e (`192.168.3.3`) | unplugged since 2026-09-29: the doctor's `robot.*` lines fail, expected | on |

`192.168.3.20`, not the `.10` in `SETUP.md` and the README's examples: `.10` is the Mac
Studio's cell address.

---

## Part 1 — Nick, by hand

### On the bench

- The Pi 5, its **active cooler** (the librealsense compile runs all cores for a long
  time), a microSD ≥ 32 GB and a reader.
- **The 27 W (5.1 V / 5 A) USB-C supply.** On a lesser supply a Pi 5 caps all USB ports at
  600 mA total, and the D435 is powered from that budget.
- The D435 and a short **USB 3** C-to-A cable, no hub.
- An Ethernet cable to the **office** network.
- No monitor or keyboard.

### 1. Flash

Raspberry Pi Imager → device **Raspberry Pi 5** → **Raspberry Pi OS (other) → Raspberry Pi
OS Lite (64-bit)** → the card. In the customisation step:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Hostname | `pickpc` |
| Username / password | `nick` / anything (console login only) |
| Wireless LAN | leave empty |
| SSH | enabled, **public-key only**, key = the Mac Studio's |

The key is the Mac Studio's, because the deploy runs from there:

    cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub        # on the Mac Studio; fingerprint SHA256:Xz1K1SaS…nzzDI

### 2. Assemble and boot

1. Cooler on, card in, **D435 into a blue (USB 3) port**, **Ethernet to the office
   network**.
2. Power on. First boot resizes the card and reboots: give it two minutes.

### 3. Check you can get in (from the Mac Studio)

    ssh nick@pickpc.local 'hostname -I; uname -m; sudo -n true && echo sudo-ok'

Expect a `10.0.0.x` address, `aarch64`, `sudo-ok`.

- Name doesn't resolve: the router's lease list, or
  `ping -c1 10.0.0.255 >/dev/null; arp -a | grep -i -E '2c:cf:67|d8:3a:dd|88:a2:9e|dc:a6:32|e4:5f:01'`.
- No `sudo-ok` (sudo wants a password): once, on the Pi —
  `echo "nick ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/010-nick-nopasswd && sudo chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/010-nick-nopasswd && sudo visudo -c`
- Host-key warning after a re-flash: `ssh-keygen -R pickpc.local` and `-R <ip>`.

### 4. Hand over

    Pi address on the office LAN: 10.0.0.___

Prompt for Fable: *"The Pi 5 is up at nick@10.0.0.___ — follow PI.md part 2."*

Don't upgrade, install or configure anything on it first.

---

## Part 2 — Fable, over SSH

You are on the Mac Studio in this checkout. Load the **`deploy-pick-pc`** skill and follow
it; the steps below are the first-run specifics it doesn't know. Use the Pi's **IP
address**, never `pickpc.local`: the installer's firewall drops inbound mDNS, so the name
stops resolving when the deploy finishes.

### 0. Before touching the Pi

- Session-start audit. Nick edits `TODO.md` by hand in this tree — an `M TODO.md` you
  didn't make is his; leave it, stage by path.
- Fresh branch off `origin/dev`; fixes to `deploy/pi/` are expected.
- `env -u UR_CELL python3 -m pytest tests/test_deploy_pi.py -q` green before you start.

### 1. Preflight

The skill's table, plus:

    ssh nick@<ip> '. /etc/os-release; echo $ID $VERSION_CODENAME; uname -r; python3 -V; systemctl --version | head -1'
    ssh nick@<ip> 'cat /proc/device-tree/model; free -m; df -h / /var/tmp; nproc'
    ssh nick@<ip> 'vcgencmd get_throttled; vcgencmd measure_temp; vcgencmd get_config usb_max_current_enable'
    ssh nick@<ip> 'nmcli -t -f NAME,TYPE,DEVICE con show; ip -br addr; ip route'

- Record the codename and systemd version. The image published 2026-09-15 is trixie; on
  trixie (systemd ≥ 254) the unit's restart back-off works.
- `get_throttled` must be `0x0`. `usb_max_current_enable=0` means the supply did not
  negotiate 5 A and USB is capped at 600 mA: tell Nick before blaming the camera.
- D435 link speed (the skill's sysfs one-liner): `5000` = USB 3; `480` = wrong port or
  cable.

### 2. Deploy

    scripts/deploy-pi.sh nick@<ip> --cell ur3 --robot-host 192.168.3.3

- **Background, 2 h limit, poll.** The build has never been timed on a board. `install.sh`
  sizes jobs as RAM / 1536 MiB. Watch:
  `ssh nick@<ip> 'tail -n 3 /var/tmp/perceptronics-build/cmake-build.log; vcgencmd measure_temp'`.
- A killed run is safe to repeat but **starts the build from scratch** (`install.sh`
  removes the build tree before cloning). Two failed attempts → stop and describe.
- `--robot-host 192.168.3.3` makes the firewall admit :7621/:7622 from `192.168.3.0/24`
  only, so on the office LAN the cockpit is reached through a tunnel (step 3). SSH stays
  open.
- Note the wall-clock build time from the `[install HH:MM:SS]` lines.

### 3. Verify

    scripts/deploy-pi.sh nick@<ip> --doctor-only
    ssh nick@<ip> 'systemctl is-active perceptronics-cockpit; journalctl -u perceptronics-cockpit -b -n 40 --no-pager'
    ssh nick@<ip> 'sudo nft list table inet perceptronics; ss -ltn | grep -E ":762[12]"'
    ssh -f -N -L 7621:127.0.0.1:7621 nick@<ip> && curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7621/api/info | head -c 600

(Kill the tunnel after: `pkill -f "7621:127.0.0.1:7621"`. Use another local port if a
cockpit on the Mac holds :7621.)

Good, with the robot unplugged: `sdk` ok at `/opt/librealsense/lib/librealsense2.so`;
`camera … usb 3.x`; `cockpit … fps ~30` with `seq` advancing between two reads. The
`robot.*` lines **fail** — expected, report them verbatim. `handeye` reads `env:` (the
2026-09-27 solve from `ur3.env`); leave it.

Each of the README's *Open items* gets a yes/no from this run:

| Open item | How to answer it |
| --- | --- |
| librealsense builds on arm64 Debian outside Docker | the deploy finished; note the minutes |
| `nft -c` accepts the rendered firewall | `nft list table` shows the table |
| the unit is valid | `systemd-analyze verify /etc/systemd/system/perceptronics-cockpit.service` |
| the **hardened, non-root** unit opens the D435 | frames advancing. If access fails while `sudo perceptronics-doctor --stream` (service stopped) works, look at `DeviceAllow=` / `DevicePolicy=` |
| hardening score | `systemd-analyze security perceptronics-cockpit` |
| the D435 holds on the Pi 5's USB budget | 10 min streaming: `seq` advancing, `get_throttled` still `0x0`, no `Frame didn't arrive` in the journal |
| per-frame cost | `curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{time_total}\n' http://127.0.0.1:7621/api/color.png` ×10; `top` for the cockpit process |

### 4. The cell address (when Nick is ready to move the cable)

Set it last: this cuts the office-LAN session, and the Pi is only reachable again once
its cable is on the cell switch and the Mac Studio's cell interface (`192.168.3.10`) is up.

    ssh nick@<ip> 'nmcli -t -f NAME,TYPE,DEVICE con show'      # the ethernet connection's name
    ssh nick@<ip> 'sudo nmcli con mod "<name>" ipv4.method manual ipv4.addresses 192.168.3.20/24 && sudo reboot'

No gateway: the cell network has no route out, and in service the box is offline. Then
Nick moves the cable, and:

    ssh nick@192.168.3.20 'ip -br addr; sudo perceptronics-doctor'

Check the address survived the reboot. If the Pi doesn't come back on `.20`, it is a
10-minute re-flash, or a monitor and keyboard and `nmcli con mod "<name>" ipv4.method auto`.
To bring it back to the office LAN for an update that needs internet, the same command
over SSH from the cell side.

### 5. If something breaks

- Fix it **in the repo** (`deploy/pi/`, `scripts/deploy-pi.sh`), regression test first in
  `tests/test_deploy_pi.py`, commit, redeploy. Never hand-edit the unit or the firewall on
  the Pi.
- Build failed: `/var/tmp/perceptronics-build/cmake-{configure,build}.log`. `Killed` /
  `internal compiler error` = memory; a thermal crawl shows in `measure_temp`.
- The Pi is expendable. The UR3e's controller is not — nothing in this runbook sends
  motion, and nothing should.

### 6. Write it down, then PR

- `deploy/pi/README.md`: each verified *Open item* moves out with its date and number
  (build minutes, OS codename, USB link, frame timings); the `192.168.3.10` examples →
  `.20`; drop the gateway from the static-address example.
- `SETUP.md` §2 and §4: the Pi 5 test board, its address, "first run 2026-10-0x".
- `TODO.md`: close the pick-PC OS question with the codename you saw.
- Memory: one entry for the Pi (address, user, what was verified).
- Draft PR into `dev` if anything under `deploy/` or `scripts/` changed; docs-only can
  auto-merge.

## Part 3 — testing the setup portal and update bundles (PR #59, written 2026-10-03)

The state on 2026-10-03 evening: the Pi has the **build #2 card** in it (flashed unseeded from
perceptronics.advin.io/imager.json). It has **no login user and no SSH**, and it predates the
portal, so nothing can be installed on it. The portal is on branch `feature/pi-setup-portal`
(worktree `../perceptronics-pi-setup`, draft PR #59, stacked on #49). It has passed tests,
but **has not run on a board**. The test board for it is the **old card**: hand-deployed, Wi-Fi
`10.0.0.56`, your key, passwordless sudo. Because SSH rides the Wi-Fi, changing eth0 never
cuts the session.

*(2026-10-06: #59 merged on 10-04; the branch for this run is `test/pi-setup-portal-on-board` off `dev`.)*

What the portal is: `http://<Pi>/setup` (`:7621` works too), login `admin` / `admin`. It sets the Pi's
network (address, mask, gateway, DNS, robot address, robot DHCP) and installs a
`perceptronics-update-*.tar` with automatic rollback. Reference: `deploy/pi/README.md`
§Setup portal.

### Nick, by hand (~5 min)

1. Unplug the Pi's power. The build #2 card has no SSH, so there is no clean shutdown; it's
   idle, so that's fine. Take that card out and keep it (it is the "older card" to reflash
   later).
2. Put the **old card** back in (it went through a power yank on 2026-10-03; if it doesn't
   boot, say so). Keep the cable from the Pi's Ethernet to the Mac Studio's `en0`, and the
   D435 in a blue port.
3. Set the Mac's Ethernet to static. It is on DHCP now and took the robot's address `.3`
   from the Pi:
   `sudo networksetup -setmanual "Ethernet" 192.168.3.10 255.255.255.0`
4. Power the Pi on. Tell Claude "old card is in".

### Claude, over SSH from the Mac Studio

Work from `../perceptronics-pi-setup`, branch `feature/pi-setup-portal`. Pull first; check
`git log --since=12.hours` for another session's commits. Every step's result goes in the
log at the end of this section.

1. **Preflight.** `ssh nick@10.0.0.56 true`. Then `cat /etc/perceptronics/cell.env
   /etc/perceptronics/network.env`; `network.env` must not exist yet. Then `nmcli -t
   connection show`. Expect the hand-made `netplan-eth0` (192.168.3.20) and the Wi-Fi.
2. **Install the branch:** `PYTHON=/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 scripts/deploy-pi.sh
   nick@10.0.0.56`. Then check:
   - `systemctl is-active perceptronics-admin.path` → active.
   - `/etc/perceptronics/network.env` now exists, `CELL_IF=eth0`, `CELL_ADDRESS=192.168.3.20/24`.
   - `/var/lib/perceptronics/admin/queue` is owned by `perceptronics`.
   - `/var/lib/perceptronics-admin` is `root:perceptronics 0750`.
   - From the Mac: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' http://192.168.3.20:7621/setup` → `401`.
     With `-u admin:admin` → `200`.
3. **The page by eye.** Open `http://192.168.3.20:7621/setup` in a browser on the Mac. Log in.
   It should show the current address, robot `192.168.3.3`, the release, and "installed by
   hand" for the image. Screenshot it for the PR.
4. **Network change, then back.** On the page: address `192.168.50.20`, mask
   `255.255.255.0`, no gateway, robot `192.168.50.3`, robot DHCP off. Apply. Expect:
   - `journalctl -u perceptronics-admin -n 50` shows `install.sh --network` finishing.
   - `ip -4 addr show eth0` has **both** `192.168.50.20/24` and `192.168.3.20/24`.
   - `sudo nft list ruleset` allows 7621/7622 from `192.168.50.0/24` and `192.168.3.0/24`.
   - `UR_HOST=192.168.50.3` in cell.env, and the cockpit restarted.
   - The page still loads at `http://192.168.3.20:7621/setup` (rescue address).
   - Give the Mac a second address, `sudo ifconfig en0 alias 192.168.50.10 255.255.255.0`.
     The page then loads at `http://192.168.50.20:7621/setup` too.

   Then set it back: `192.168.3.20` / `255.255.255.0` / robot `192.168.3.3` / robot DHCP
   **on**. Only `192.168.3.20/24` should remain on eth0. Remove the alias with `sudo ifconfig
   en0 -alias 192.168.50.10`.
5. **Settings survive an update.** Redeploy with `scripts/deploy-pi.sh nick@10.0.0.56` and no
   network flags. `network.env` and eth0 must be unchanged.
6. **An update through the portal.** Make one small, visible commit on the branch, e.g. a
   line in this file. Then `scripts/pi-update.sh bundle` and `scripts/pi-update.sh push
   target/pi-update/perceptronics-update-*.tar 192.168.3.20`. Expect the log to end in
   `done: updated to …` and `/opt/perceptronics/current` to point at the new release. Upload
   the same file once more through the browser page too, to check the progress bar and the
   restart message.
7. **A rollback.** Make a broken bundle in a scratch copy, never on the branch:
   `git worktree add <scratchpad>/broken HEAD`, append `raise RuntimeError("broken on purpose")`
   to `perceptronics/webapp.py` there, and run that copy's `scripts/pi-update.sh bundle`. Push
   it. Expect `rolled_back` within ~2½ min, `current` back on the release from step 6, and the
   cockpit answering. Remove the scratch worktree afterwards.
8. **Refusals on the real board.**
   - A truncated bundle: `head -c 100000 bundle.tar > cut.tar`, then push. Expect it refused,
     nothing changed.
   - A wrong password: expect 401.
   - A POST without `X-Perceptronics-Admin`: expect 403.
9. **Image #3** with the portal in it:
   `PYTHON=/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 scripts/pi-image.sh build nick@10.0.0.56 --cell ur3`
   (~12 min; set `PYTHON` because `pi-image.sh` takes the first `python3` even without pip).
   Log it in `deploy/pi/image/README.md` §Iteration log. **Ask Nick before** publishing it
   to the site (`site/site.sh image` in `../perceptronics-site-any-robot`, whose own changes
   are still uncommitted).
10. **The real target: a fresh card.** Nick flashes build #3 unseeded onto the build #2 card
    (reflashing it is the "upgrade" for cards made before the portal). Boot it, and redo
    steps 3, 4 and 6 against `192.168.3.20` with no SSH at all. That is the operator's path
    end to end.

If something breaks: two failed attempts, then stop and write down what you tried. A Pi
that lost eth0 is still on Wi-Fi: `sudo /opt/perceptronics/deploy/install.sh --network
--cell-address 192.168.3.20/24 --robot-host 192.168.3.3 --gateway none --dns none
--cell-dhcp auto` puts it back.

Afterwards: fill in the log below, move PR #59 out of draft only if 2–8 passed, update
`deploy/pi/README.md` (drop "not yet run on a board"), the CLAUDE.md paragraph, and the
`perceptronics-pi5-pickpc` memory.

| Step | Date | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Preflight | 2026-10-06 | pass. Old card booted after the 10-03 power yank. `cell.env` as deployed 10-03; no `network.env`; `netplan-eth0` 192.168.3.20 + Wi-Fi 10.0.0.56; D435 on USB 3 (5000 Mb/s); `get_throttled` 0x0. Release before: 0.1.0-389b242fb0fa. |
| 2 Install | 2026-10-06 | pass, after one repo fix: the first run died at the copy (`scp: local .../deploy/pi/image is not a regular file` — #49 gave `deploy/pi/` a subdirectory; `deploy-pi.sh` now copies with `-r`, regression test in `tests/test_deploy_pi.py`). Second run: 15 s to the doctor (librealsense already built). `perceptronics-admin.path` active; `network.env` written (`CELL_IF=eth0`, `CELL_ADDRESS=192.168.3.20/24`, `CELL_DHCP=auto`); queue `perceptronics:perceptronics 750`; `/var/lib/perceptronics-admin` `root:perceptronics 750`; `/setup` 401 without login, 200 with `admin:admin`, 401 with a wrong password. Doctor: camera usb 3.2, cockpit 30 fps; `robot.reach` fails (UR3e unplugged, expected). |
| 3 Page by eye | 2026-10-06 | pass. Chrome's own Basic-auth dialog (the extension can't drive it; Nick typed the login). Shows 192.168.3.20 (subnet 24), backup "none (same network)", robot 192.168.3.3 "handed out by this computer when asked", software 0.1.0-24e381386317, card image "installed by hand". |
| 4 Network change, back | 2026-10-06 | pass (Apply clicked by Nick: the auto-mode classifier refuses a config change on a device). Forward: `install.sh --network` finished in 3 s; eth0 `192.168.50.20/24` + `192.168.3.20/24`; nft admits `{ 192.168.3.0/24, 192.168.50.0/24 }`; `UR_HOST=192.168.50.3`; cockpit restarted; the page answered at both addresses (the Mac aliased `192.168.50.10`, `sudo` in Nick's terminal); the page shows "Backup address 192.168.3.20 (always reachable on the cable)". Back: only `192.168.3.20/24` left, `UR_HOST=192.168.3.3`, cell DHCP serving. Two findings, both fixed on the branch: the removed DHCP unit was left `failed (Result: signal)` (`remove_cell_dhcp` now `reset-failed`s it); `ALLOW_FROM` kept `192.168.50.0/24` after the move back (a `--network` run now computes the list for the new network). eth0's link bounced for 30 s after the Mac's alias came off; nothing on the Pi did it. |
| 5 Settings survive an update | 2026-10-06 | pass. `deploy-pi.sh` with no network flags: `network.env` and eth0 unchanged, release 0.1.0-1348cef48366. **Port 80** (Nick: "users won't be familiar with ports"): nftables `redirect`s :80 to :7621 from the same subnets; `http://192.168.3.20/setup` 401 / 200 / 401 from the Mac. |
| 6 Update through the portal | 2026-10-06 | pass, twice: `pi-update.sh push` (queued, checked, installed, `done: updated to 0.1.0`) and the same bundle uploaded on the page (progress strip, "Received. Installing", "Software update finished: updated to 0.1.0 (0.1.0-1348cef48366)"). The release id is the wheel's hash, so a bundle whose only changes are under `deploy/` or `tests/` is "already installed" — install.sh still re-runs the firewall, units and helper from the bundle. |
| 7 Rollback | 2026-10-06 | pass on the third run, 2 min 21 s push → `rolled_back`, cockpit answering. Run 1 found the bug: `--rollback` only swapped `current` and **left the broken bundle's deploy files** (its older firewall — port 80 gone — and `install.sh`) in place. Fix: every release keeps its deploy files + its wheel (`<release>/deploy`, `<release>/perceptronics-*.whl`, `.wheel`) and `--rollback` re-runs the previous release's own installer. Run 2 found the fix's bug: that installer copied the release's wheel onto itself (`cp: ... are the same file`, `set -e`) and the board was **left on the broken release** (the helper said "(check it)"); recovered with `deploy-pi.sh`. Run 3: full restore, firewall and deploy copy included. |
| 8 Refusals | 2026-10-06 | pass. Truncated bundle: "bundle is damaged (truncated upload?): unexpected end of data", nothing changed. Wrong password 401, no login 401, POST without `X-Perceptronics-Admin` 403 — on :7621 and on :80. |

## Later (not Thursday, not designed yet)

Nick's direction for the shipped product, 2026-09-30. Recorded so it isn't lost; none of it
is built, and it is far off.

- **Offline at runtime, hardwired to the robot.** Internet only during setup.
- **A pre-built SD image**: flash, boot, commission. Nothing compiles or downloads on a
  shipped unit.
- **SSH off** on shipped units.
- **Commissioning over a hotspot**: the box raises a Wi-Fi network during commissioning
  only, with a web page to set the wired address (DHCP or static). Stuck → power-cycle
  brings it back. *2026-10-03: the pre-built image exists (#49) and the web page
  exists, over the wired default address rather than a hotspot: the setup portal, Part 3.*
- **Board**: possibly an industrial Pi 4.
- **librealsense**: whichever build reduces dependencies and increases portability
  (`TODO.md`).

### Not in this session (needs the robot and Nick at the pendant)

1. UR3e powered, `sudo perceptronics-doctor` green on `robot.*`.
2. Pendant: remove RealSense Pilot, install Perceptronic 0.9.0 from the USB stick;
   **Installation → URCaps → Perceptronic** shows the picture with the Cockpit field at its
   default `192.168.3.20` (`PLUG-AND-PLAY.md` §3).
3. Hand-eye on the Pi if the wrist moved since 2026-09-27 (`PLUG-AND-PLAY.md` §6). The solve
   is saved to the hand-eye file and survives restarts; nothing to delete.
4. The pick kit's first run on the cell (`TODO.md`, 2026-09-28 entry).
