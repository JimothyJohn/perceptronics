# The pick PC image

One image that you flash to any new pick PC: Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) with librealsense,
the cockpit service, the udev rules and the firewall already installed. Each board gets its
own identity from a seed written to the card after flashing. The seed sets the host name,
the user and SSH key, the cell address, and the robot. This replaces the first deploy's
10-minute librealsense compile and its need for internet on the PC.

```

```

## Build

    scripts/pi-image.sh build nick@10.0.0.56 [--cell ur3] [--robot-host 192.168.3.3]

The Pi needs to be aarch64 with passwordless sudo (or run the command from a terminal so sudo
can prompt), about 12 GB free and internet access. `~/pi-image/cache` on the Pi keeps the base
download and a tarball of the built librealsense, so only the first build compiles it. The laptop keeps a copy in `target/pi-image/cache/` and hands it to a freshly
flashed builder, so rewriting the build board doesn't cost another compile. The
image, its `.sha256` and a `.manifest.txt` land in `target/pi-image/`. The manifest lists the
base image, the wheel, the librealsense stamp and every package with its version. Diff two
manifests to see what changed between builds.

Every board made from the image has `/etc/perceptronics/image-release`, which says which build
it came from.

**What the build does not touch:** the build host's firewall and services. `install.sh --image`
enables the units without starting anything, `policy-rc.d` stops package scripts from starting
daemons in the chroot, and the librealsense compile runs on the host's disk (a bind mount), not
in the image.

**What it removes:** SSH host keys (regenerated on first boot), the apt lists and cache, the
logs, and the build's `resolv.conf`. `machine-id` stays `uninitialized` as Raspberry Pi ships
it, so each board makes its own. Root is shrunk to its contents + 256 MiB, and the first
boot's `resize` (in `cmdline.txt`) grows it to fill the card.

## Flash (macOS)

    diskutil list external
    scripts/pi-image.sh flash target/pi-image/<name>.img.xz disk4

The flash command refuses the Mac's boot disk and anything that isn't removable or external.
It shows the disk and asks you to type its id before it erases it. It writes with `sudo dd`,
so run it in a terminal. Raspberry Pi Imager's "Use custom" works too, but **don't** apply
Imager's OS customisation: it writes the same three files the seed does.

## Seed: what makes the card one board

    scripts/pi-image.sh seed /Volumes/bootfs --hostname pickpc2 --user nick \
        --ssh-key ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub --address 192.168.3.21/24 \
        --robot-host 192.168.3.3 [--cell ur3] [--wifi-ssid NAME]
    diskutil eject /Volumes/bootfs

| Flag | Becomes |
| --- | --- |
| `--hostname` | the host name (`<name>.local` over mDNS, avahi is in the image) |
| `--user`, `--ssh-key` | the login user, **SSH key only** (no password; `ssh_pwauth: false`), passwordless sudo like Raspberry Pi OS's default user |
| `--address` | eth0's static address. Omit it for DHCP. `--gateway` / `--dns` only if the network has a way out; the cell normally has none |
| `--wifi-ssid` | optional Wi-Fi. The password comes from `PERCEPTRONICS_WIFI_PSK` or a prompt, never the command line |
| `--robot-host`, `--cell`, `--allow-from` | on the first boot, `install.sh --reconfigure` rewrites `/etc/perceptronics/cell.env` and the firewall for this robot (offline: the wheel is in the image). Log: `/var/log/perceptronics-seed.log` |

Without the robot flags the board keeps the image's default `cell.env` (the cell it was built
with). Every value is validated, and the files are written as JSON (valid YAML), so nothing
typed can add a key or a command. `cloud-init schema` accepts both files (checked on the Pi,
2026-10-02). Each seed gets a new `instance-id`, so re-seeding a card that has already booted
runs the first-boot setup again.

## Checking a fresh board

    ssh nick@192.168.3.21 'cat /etc/perceptronics/image-release; cloud-init status --long; sudo perceptronics-doctor'

## Iteration log

Each rewrite of the test board gets one entry: what was built, what happened on the board,
and what changed because of it.

| # | Date | Build | Result on the board | Lesson / change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 2026-10-02 | `perceptronics-pickpc-20261003-dev-edbc1e3` on pickpc (Pi 5 4 GB): 27 min (librealsense 15, xz 10), 687 MB xz / 3.3 GB raw | not flashed yet. Loop-mounted: fsck clean, no host keys, machine-id `uninitialized`, cockpit + nftables enabled, librealsense loads in the chroot (API 25804), the build host's firewall and service untouched | first try died at the bind mount (`/var/tmp/perceptronics-build` doesn't exist in a stock image); cleanup left nothing mounted. Rebuilds reuse the librealsense tarball (~15 min saved); xz -6 is now the slow step |
| 1 | 2026-10-02 | `perceptronics-pickpc-20261003-91365ff3d144`, the first through `scripts/pi-image.sh build`: 12.5 min (librealsense from the cache tarball, xz 10 min), 673 MB | not flashed yet | the wrapper path works end to end (stage → build → fetch → sha256). **Unexplained:** it re-downloaded the base although a verified copy was cached minutes earlier; the same check reports `cached-ok` afterwards. Watch the next build's first line |
| 2 | 2026-10-03 | `perceptronics-pickpc-20261003-f96fafa299ca` on pickpc: 12 min (librealsense from the cache, xz 9 min), 647 MiB; the first image with the cell port baked in (no seed needed). Published at perceptronics.advin.io/imager.json | flashed with Raspberry Pi Imager 2.0.11 (`--repo` that list), **no seed**, booted in ~30 s: eth0 `192.168.3.20`, cockpit 200 on :7621, D435 open at 848×480 @ 30 on USB 3.2, :7622 listening. The Mac's Ethernet, left on DHCP, was handed `192.168.3.3` — the cell DHCP works, and takes the robot's lease from anything that asks | an unseeded card has no login user, so no SSH: the cockpit is the only way in. Set a laptop on the cell to a static `192.168.3.x`, never DHCP. Updating such a card needs a path that isn't SSH (next: update bundles through the cockpit) |
| 3 | 2026-10-06 | `perceptronics-pickpc-20261006-3a909cefbcdf` on pickpc (the old card, 05:42–05:55): 12.5 min (base cached + sha256 ok, librealsense from the cache, install.sh `--image` 33 s, xz 10 min), 686 MiB; sha256 `33b901ba…c67c67`. The first image with the **setup portal** (`/setup`, port 80 → :7621, update bundles with the installer-based rollback) and with every release keeping its deploy files | not flashed yet — step 10 of `PI.md` part 3: Nick flashes it unseeded onto the build #2 card and redoes the portal's network change, page upload and rollback with **no SSH**. Not published to the site (ask Nick) | the run was clean; the portal's fixes of the day (`deploy/pi/PI.md` log) are in it |
